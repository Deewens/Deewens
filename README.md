### Hi there, I'm Adrien 👋

Passionnate about programming, and since recently, computer games development.  
My GitHub profile is populated with some university and personal projects, the public repositories are the one I am the most proud.

- 👨‍🎓 I hold a two year **University Diploma of Technology in Computer Science** and a one year **Professional Degree and Apprenticeship in Computer Science** that I did in France.
- 🌱 I’m currently a fourth year student in a **Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Games Development** at the **South East Technological University** (SETU) in Ireland.
- 🔭 I'm planning to do a two years **Master in video games** from September 2023.
